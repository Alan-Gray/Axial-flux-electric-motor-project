| *Final design for the CAD model* | *The three versions of the mechanical design* |

I had two goals for the mechanical design of the motor:
* Make the shaft spin well
* Make it easy to assemble

I made the CAD models in Fusion 360. I used an iterative design approach, where I would 3D print parts and see how they perform. After 3 versions, I landed on a design I was happy.
