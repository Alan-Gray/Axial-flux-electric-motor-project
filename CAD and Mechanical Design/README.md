| *CAD model of final design* | *The three versions of the mechanical design* |

I had two goals for the mechanical design of the motor:
* Make the shaft spin well
* Make it easy to assemble

I made the CAD models in Fusion 360. I used an iterative design approach, where I would 3D print parts and see how they perform. After 3 versions, I landed on a design I was happy. 

The biggest challange I faced was deciding how to attach the rotors to the shaft. I went throught many different versions, and eventually landed on a more modular design.

|*Shaft and rotor hubs*| *Rotor and Rotor hubs*|

The main reason I went for this design is that it lets me change the rotor hub design without needing to completely remake the rotor. Magnets are expensive, and I didn't want to glue the magnets to the rotor only to realize it doesnt fit on the shaft correctly. The hubs screw onto the shaft, and the rotor screws onto the plate.
