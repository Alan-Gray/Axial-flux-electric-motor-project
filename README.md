Over the past year I have become increasingly interested in electric motors. I built a small axial flux generator as part of a university course and had alot of fun building it, but there were many things I could've done better. My goal for this project was to refine my previous design to run as a motor and to create a more efficient machine. My focus for this project was making the shaft spin well, reducing the airgap, and improving the electrical and magnetic design of the motor.

I'm currently working on the next stage of this project, so some sections might change over time. I've split each section into its own folder. Enjoy!
