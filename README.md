Over the past year I have become increasingly interested in electric motors. I built a small axial flux generator as part of a university course and had alot of fun building it, but there were many things I could've done better. My goal for this project was to refine my previous design to run as a motor and to create a more efficient machine. My particular focus for this project was reducing the airgap and improving the electrical and magnetic design of the motor.

I've split each section into its own folder. Enjoy!
