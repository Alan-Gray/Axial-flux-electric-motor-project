| *3D magetic simulation* |
Whilst I had a good amount of experience using 2D simulations, 3D simulations were something new for this project. Orignially, I wanted to use ANSYS Maxwell. However, the student license imposed a mesh limit, making it hard for me simulate the full motor. 

After some searching, I found that some of the university computers had a full license of ANSYS Workbench. It was older and had less features, it was sufficient for my use case.

# Learning more about FEA 
Whilst I was looking for a different software to use, I found an open source solver called Elmer. It was more complex and hard to use but it forced me to understand more about finite element simulaitions and how they work.
