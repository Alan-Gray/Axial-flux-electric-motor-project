| *3D magetic simulation* |

While I had a good amount of experience using 2D simulations, 3D simulations were something new for this project. Orignially, I wanted to use ANSYS Maxwell. However, the student version imposed a mesh limit, making it hard for me simulate the full motor.

Because of this, I had to find a different software and eventually found an open source solver called Elmer. It was more complex and hard to use but it forced me to understand
