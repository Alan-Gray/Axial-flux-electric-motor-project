| *A coreless coil* |

The electrical design focused on lowering the internal resistance of the coils. This was done primarily by using a thicker wire guage. I chose to use use the thickest wire I had available, which was 18 gauge wire (1 mm diameter). Each coil had 50 turns of wire, which I wound by hand. 18 AWG wire is the thickest wire I can reasonably wind by hand, and if I want to use thicker wire Ill need to make a specialized winder of some kind. 

The impedance of the coils was measured using an impedance analyser. The impedance of a single coil was around 0.2 Ohms for low frequencies (<1kHz). The inductance of each coil is about 15 $\micro\text{H}$. The previous version had 10 Ohms per coil, so the new motor has 50 times less internal resistance per coil.
